# MyBlog
This is one of my works about a blog. So I created my own blog using CodeIgniter 3. In my opinion, the blog that I created is not perfect. However, for some mechanisms I try to be a little bit the same as wordpress. I have used this blog for some of my writings about the process of creating several website projects that I created. And in the end, I moved to using wordpress for my blog.
Therefore, I am posting this project on my github for all of you to use. Please use the blog that I created, it's up to you what you want and don't forget to give credit. Thank you
